  Just then her head struck against
  the roof of the hall  in
fact she was now more than nine
feet high and she at once took
up the little golden key and
 hurried off to the garden door

 You ought to be ashamed of
  yourself said Alice a great
girl like you she might well
 say this to go on crying in
this way Stop this moment I
tell you But she went on all
the same shedding gallons of
 tears until there was a large pool
all round her about four inches
deep and reaching half down the
hall
